    "### 1. **95% Confidence Intervals**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: What does a 95% confidence interval for a population mean signify?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) The interval contains 95% of all sample means.\n",
    "- B) The population mean is within the interval with 95% certainty.\n",
    "- C) If we were to take many samples, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the population mean.\n",
    "- D) There is a 95% probability that any sample mean lies within the interval.\n",

    "### 2. **Standard Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Which of the following best describes the standard error of the mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) It is the standard deviation of the population.\n",
    "- B) It measures the accuracy with which a sample represents a population.\n",
    "- C) It represents the spread of data within a single sample.\n",
    "- D) It indicates the variability of data points within a sample.\n",

    "### 3. **Sample vs Sampling Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: What is the difference between a sample distribution and a sampling distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) A sample distribution is the distribution of observations within a sample, while a sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic across all possible samples of the same size.\n",
    "- B) A sample distribution is always normal, but a sampling distribution is not.\n",
    "- C) A sampling distribution refers only to the sample's variance, while a sample distribution refers to its mean.\n",
    "- D) There is no difference; they are the same concept.\n",

    "**Question**: Which statement best describes a test statistic?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) It is a value that represents the average outcome of a hypothesis test.\n",
    "- B) It is a measure that quantifies the difference between observed data and what is expected under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- C) It always represents the probability that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- D) It is calculated only in one-sample tests.\n",

    "- A) There is a 3% chance that the null hypothesis is false.\n",
    "- B) There is a 3% chance that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- C) There is a 3% probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- D) There is a 97% chance that the observed result is due to random chance.\n",

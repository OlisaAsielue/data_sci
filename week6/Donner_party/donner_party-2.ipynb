    "# The Donner Party\n",
    "In 1846 the Donner and Reed families left Springfield, Illinois, for  California by covered wagon. In July, the Donner Party, as it  became known, reached Fort Bridger, Wyoming. There its leaders  decided to attempt a new and untested route to the Sacramento  Valley. Having reached its full size of 87 people and 20 wagons, the  party was delayed by a difficult crossing of the Wasatch Range and again in the crossing of the desert west of the Great Salt Lake. The  group became stranded in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains when the region was hit by heavy snows in late October. By the  time the last survivor was rescued on April 21, 1847, 40 of the 87  members had died from famine and exposure to extreme cold."

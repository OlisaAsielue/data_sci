    "**Question**: What does a 95% confidence interval for a population mean signify?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) The interval contains 95% of all sample means.\n",
    "- B) The population mean is within the interval with 95% certainty.\n",
    "- C) If we were to take many samples, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the population mean.\n",
    "- D) There is a 95% probability that any sample mean lies within the interval.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A) A sample distribution is the distribution of observations within a sample, while a sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic across all possible samples of the same size.\n",
    "- B) A sample distribution is always normal, but a sampling distribution is not.\n",
    "- C) A sampling distribution refers only to the sample's variance, while a sample distribution refers to its mean.\n",

    "- C) There is a 3% probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
